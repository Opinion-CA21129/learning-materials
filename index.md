# Welcome to the OPINION network learning resources! 
---
This material is based upon work from COST Action (CA21129) **What are Opinions? Integrating Theory and Methods for Automatically Analyzing Opinionated Communication (OPINION)**, supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology). <br>

The learning resources accessible from this page were designed primarily as teaching materials for the [COST Action Training School in Computational Opinion Analysis (COpA)](url) that took place in June 2024 at the University of Salamanca, Spain.<br> 

Lecturers are welcome to use the materials in their teaching and adapt them as needed, respecting the CC license. Learners are welcome to use them on their own as tutorials. <br>
